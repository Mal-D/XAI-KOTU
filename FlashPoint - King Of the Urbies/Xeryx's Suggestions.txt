Xeryx's Suggestions
1. Up Johannas Zhao's skills
2. Test a vastly updated MSK-10X
3. Run at 50% armor
4. Reduce the Taurian lance and make them all medium recon faster mechs.

I'm thinking the following 
>> Choose BigBattle and if lose got to Zhao duel lose again and just end the FP. (I've already got this one done)
@@ Choose BigBattle and if win (Progress(MackieCount) of 4,5,6,7) got to son duel(withholding payment etc) - lose and end the FP with reduced reward. (player has to get something after all)
## Choose BigBattle and if win (Progress(MackieCount) of 4,5,6,7) got to son duel(withholding payment etc) - win again take ToppleTiff Holdings to the cleaners.

Choose Zhao dual and if lose got to bigBattle  - lose again and just end the FP.
Choose Zhao dual and if win got to son duel (withholding payment etc) - lose and end the FP (small reward).
Choose Zhao dual and if win got to son duel (withholding payment etc) - win again take ToppleTiff Holdings to the cleaners.
